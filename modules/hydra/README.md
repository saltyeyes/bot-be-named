# SHEET MANAGEMENT Commands - Hydra

Does Google Sheets annoy you? Don't worry, it annoys us, too! With this module, though,
you'll be able to save many clicks.

Now with 2 more Heads!

Use `~help Hydra` on the bot to know the commands in this module.

### But why Hydra?

- As anyone who knows Greek mythology knows, the second labour after the (Nemean) **Lion** was.. the (Lernaean) **Hydra**. So... it's the next obvious module after Lion. 
- And why was the previous module named Lion? Because the **Lion** constellation (Leo) directly comes after the **Crab** one (Cancer). So Lion was the next obvious module after Crab.
- And why was the first module called Crab? Because.. well it was actually short of create-tab. Like chancrab was channel-create-tab.

More honestly though, we find it much easier for everyone to understand and remember our functions if every "bundle" of them is memorably named. So we accidentally found a theme and stuck with it. 

### What did each module have?
