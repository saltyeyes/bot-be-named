# SHEET MANAGEMENT Commands - Lion

Does Google Sheets annoy you? Don't worry, it annoys us, too! With this module, though,
you'll be able to save many clicks

Use `~help Lion` on the bot to know the commands in this module.

### But why Lion?

- As anyone who knows Western constellations knows, because the **Lion** constellation (Leo) directly comes after the **Crab** one (Cancer). So Lion was the next obvious module after Crab.
- And why was the first module called Crab? Because.. well it was actually short of create-tab. Like chancrab was channel-create-tab.

More honestly though, we find it much easier for everyone to understand and remember our functions if every "bundle" of them is memorably named. So we accidentally found a theme and stuck with it. 

### What did each module have?

The modules so far have been -
- **Crab** : OG module, 2021-22, now removed ([1](https://github.com/kevslinger/bot-be-named/commit/b6d6a49) and [2](https://github.com/kevslinger/bot-be-named/commit/2017c2e)). Contained "Tab cloning" on GSheet.
- **Lion** (you are here) : 2022-24, currently "stable". Contains "Tab cloning", "Overview sheet update" and "Moving tabs around" on GSheet. Contains "Update solved status and answers from discord" on GSheets-Discord.
- **Hydra** : 2024 - ???. Currently under work.
